12-02-2004	I have implemented a simple AES encryption of the
		shared memory segment. This feature is optional and
		even quite experimental for now. I have done around
		200 tests with this feature and it worked flawlessly.
		I can't predict how it will work on other machines but
		I'm happy if I get some feedback. I have also added
		a question in the FAQ file concerning a "weird" bug I
		experienced ONCE in those tests.
