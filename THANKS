1.)	Thanks to Corcalciuc Gh. Valentin for supplying the original 
	pin toggling algorithm which is of course was essential for this 
	program's functionality!
2.)	Thanks to Martin Grimme (martin@pycage.de) for turning my
	useless .display file into a functional desklet!
3.)	Thanks to the neon lamp in my room, which gave its life for my
	struggle to implement new features and stabilise this program.
	May its soul rest in peace!
