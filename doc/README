PPort pport (console application)

	PPort is a simple yet handy program and its documented counterpart
for accessing the output pins of a parallel port. Using this bundle, one can
successfully control any household appliance or electronic device with
minimal hassle and practically no changes.

	To compile the program use the generic:

	./configure && make && make install

which should check if the program is compatible with your machine, compile
the program and install it. Of course the installation directory is settable
by supplying flags to the configure script.

Currently the configure script accepts some parameters amongst the
traditional autoconf parameters which may be essential to make PPort work
better than using the default values:

	./configure --with-parport=0x432

This parameter will make PPort use the parallel port found at the hex
address 0x432 (an example fictive value) which is generally available 
in the BIOS. This is somewhat essential to running PPort successfully, 
since that will be the port that PPort will try to access. By default, 
if this option is not specified, PPort assumes that your parallel port 
is found at the address 0x378.

	./configure --with-dfile=/tmp/mydatafile

This parameter will make PPort use the file specified in the path above as
its data file. This is useful for pin restoration and various other tracker
elements. By default, if this option is not specified, PPort will use the
"old" data file /tmp/.pport.data.

	./configre --with-secrecy=Whateveryoumaylike

Ma by useful for somewhat paranoid people, this EXPERIMENTAL feature
introduced from version 0.5k will attempt to encrypt the shared memory
segment that PPort uses. Thus, a common user on your system, won't be able
to guess what devices you are currently powering unless he/she has the
decryption key, which is specified with this option. In this example 
"Whateveryoumaylike" is the current key and in order to set your own just 
substitute it with whatever you may like.

	./configure --with-cfgfile=/etc/pportd.conf

Using this configure option one can specify the path to the configuration
file of the pportd daemon other than the default.


PPort gDesklet (graphical python-gtk interface)

	Iff you wish to use the desklet provided under the desklet/ directory, 
you'll need to install gdesklets which you can obtain from:
 
		http://gdesklets.gnomedesktop.org/ 

and its requirements. Then you'll need sudo, and you'll have to add a line
to /etc/sudoers which will be something like this:

	user	ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 2
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 3
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 4
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 5
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 6
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 7
	user    ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 8
	user	ALL=NOPASSWD:pport -t 9

where you replace "user" by the user you want to be able to run pport.
This step is vital since pport requires root priviledges. Then install
the desklet (read the "README" in desklet/) and you should be set to
go. :)
